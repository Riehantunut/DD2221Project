# DD2221Project
- The first step is to download the historical data.
 - The data will be refined with the use of \textit{Spark} to improve quality.
 - Queries will be run against the dataset with the use of \textit{Spark SQL} in order to gain a better understanding.
 - The dataset will be split  into a \textit{train}, \textit{validation}, and \textit{test} set.
 - Different  models will be trained by using \textit{Spark ML} for time series prediction.
 - The best model will be chosen by testing the different models on the  \textit{validation} set. The models will be evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error.
 - Finally the chosen model will tested on the  \textit{test} set.
 - Predictions and training data will be visualized to provide the reader with a clearer understanding of the mode.
